# Primary Idea - What does Twitter think?

Using IBM's Watson and its Tone Analyzer, we plan to analyze the tone and sentiments of tweets about movies to recommend movies to a user. This API will reveal tones such as anger, fear, joy, and sadness to help us better understand the way that people feel about a given movie. We will also be using an API for a movie database to give the application a sample of movies to scour for on Twitter, using the Twitter API.  Additionally, the movie database will tell us the genre of a given movie so that we can sort recommendations by genre, and thus the user can search for recommendations by genre. We will also include a user database for login, so that a user may save movie titles to their account for later, and potentially also save their genre preferences.


# Secondary Idea - Event Notifications & Transport

The user can enter an event going on in their area and then get a notification on their phone about when they should leave for the event based on public transportation times.  We would use the MBTA API, and an events API to save times and dates.  The user could have a profile that saves all of their upcoming events so that the program can remind the user of them and what time they should leave later.
