We chose to use flask because our project is backend-heavy.
Moreover, it is intuitive and accessible. 
Every one on the team knows Python and the code is easy to 
understand. Each team member is able to make his/her contributions,
so flask is ideal for building this simple prototype. We might 
introduce other languages and libraries as we build in more
features later on. For the front end, we are likely going to use
Jinja2, since it's already built in to flask.
