User Authentication:

One feature that we'll be adding is the ability for the user to log in. This will enable us to store data from the user 
in our database. That way the user can do stuff like save searches and favorites. We'd like for the user to be able to sign 
in through some other third party service such as Google so they don't need to have an additional account through us.
